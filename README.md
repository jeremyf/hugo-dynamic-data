This is a Hugo site. Its purpose is to explore some of the dynamic
aspects of Hugo.

In particular, I'm looking at how to render data structures that conform to
schemas. Note, I don't have schemas defined, but I'm looking at how to dispatch
rendering based on an attribute's well-formed properties.

The [./layouts/index.html](/layouts/index.html) contains an example of
dispatching rendering. It also provides insight into how to render JSON
documents from the dynamic data.

You can see the rendered results at [public/index.html](/public/index.html)
